title: It Does't Hurt Until It Does
---

I went hiking yesterday. A moderate day hike in NH to get some fresh air and stretch my legs.

The trail was truly uninteresting except for some patches of ice from the recent snow melt.

My friend meandered along the path as I followed behind. As we talked about a lot of things, I was suddenly knocked of my feet as my head crashed into a down tree.

Damn did that hurt.

A funny thing though. I was feeling quite good for the entire hike. Hitting my head was a low probability occurence, but it sure had a big impact.

Following is a perfectly acceptable alternative to blazing your own path. Until it isn't.
