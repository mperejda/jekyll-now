title: The Long Road is the Shortcut

We all want to be great at something. Some of us want to be great at many things. 

How to you get there? Working hard is a good answer. No one can fault you for that one. Work smart. Yes, that is important too. I feel like these answers are the equivalent of explaining that someone is rich because they have a lot of money. Duh...

I argue that consitent, focused energy is the key to "success" however you define it. Most things we dream about accomplishing in life appear are built over months and years. To achieve the results you desire, you msut persist over a long period of time.

We tend to overestimate what we can do in one day, but fail to realize the true potential of what is possble in, say, an entire year. It is easy to mistake a work in progress for a failure if you are not viewing the work if your are thinking on the wrong time scale.

There is nothing glamorous about this path. I believe this principle is the key to accomplishing big goals. Compound interest is a powerful thing and applies to your time just as surely as it does to your money.

Don't take my word for it though. 

Apply these ideas and see what happens...
