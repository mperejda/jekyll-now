Why we need this
-------------------------
Mailing lists enable start ups to reach their audience and help users find out about useful products. This article will help you build the first piece of your marketing machine with lightning speed.

Getting Started
-------------------------

Gibbon & Mailchimp provide you with list managment tools and a simple CMS for crafting your message. While Happy Seed provided the tools to spin it up on a live server.

Mailchimp Setup
-------------------------
The steps for setting up Mailchimp will remain unchanged. You'll need a Mailchhimp API key, an email list, and the corresponding list id. See [Part One](http://cheshireoctopus.github.io/blog/2014/01/23/mailchimp-plus-gibbon-plus-rails-create-a-basic-sign-up-form/){:target="_blank"} for reference.

The application will run bundle automatically as prompt you to install a handful of generators. 'Splash' is necessary and 'jazz_hand' is helpful.
