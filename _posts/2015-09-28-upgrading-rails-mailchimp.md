Getting Started
-------------------------
Mailing lists are essential channels to help you reach your audience and making sure your setup right helps many founders sleep easier at night.

Mailchimp Setup
-------------------------
The steps for setting up Mailchimp will remain unchanged. You'll need a Mailchhimp API key, an email list, and the corresponding list id. See [Part One](http://cheshireoctopus.github.io/blog/2014/01/23/mailchimp-plus-gibbon-plus-rails-create-a-basic-sign-up-form/) for reference.
