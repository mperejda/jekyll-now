title: Abstraction and the Art of Problem Solving
---

There is a certain discipline required to solve the problem you actually have, with the solution that fits in context.

The 'ole phrase about asking the right questions rings true here. Solving "some" problem may be exciting or interesting, but does the solution lend itself to the intended application?

Hard telling, not knowing but asking better questions and solving more pertainent problems will save you a lot of time.

Learn Some Math and Computer Science

Math is all about abstraction to varying levels. But then again, ALL problem solving involves abstraction to some degree. I studied math in college because I studied math in college. Convinced that college math wasn't for me as I freshman, I was about to drop the pursuit. Probabaly a similar experience many people have with math/science/coding/(insert technical topic here). You need look no further than google images to see why:

So yea. As a college student, I had some doubts.

One of our professors was so brilliant, we openly refered to him as a wizard. It was rumored he'd made millions as a quant on Wall St. then left becasue the problems he was tasked to solve were BORING. The way he answered our questions before we thought of them and incepted students onto the enlightened path made... Let's just say the rumors were probably only the tip of the iceberg.

He told me something, "Nobody has ever told me they wished they took less math in college, or ever." Good point. So I stuck with it and moonlighted as a humanities major. When a wizard speaks you listen.

 Once I started applying the abtract teachings of "Dumbledore" to real problems, I began to see abstraction more like this:

 When you are solving huge, complex problems, break them down into smaller pieces. What are the system inputs? Outputs? Split the problem into sets of smaller problems until you start seeing something you can work with. 
 
 What tools do have to solve the problem? What tools are best suited to the task at hand? If the answer is something you don't know anything about. LEARN IT. Then use that tool.
 
 Try to batch your tasks and create a process. It will be slower while you get a feel for it. This is okay. A process or system can usually be tuned and sped up. When you don't have a process for solving problems, at some difficulty level you will throw up your hand and quit... At least temporarily.
 
 Even a slow process get you there and when your work compounds over time, the process will speed up.
