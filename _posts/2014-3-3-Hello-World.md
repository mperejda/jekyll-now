<p>I've been diving deep into ruby lately and I found a few things that are elementary and useful.</p>

<h3>Algorithms and Iteration:</h3>
  <p>Splitting things into well defined methods will make you a happy engineer. Smaller, robust methods that only do one thing rarely break your code or application. Strong building blocks help you build bigger and better things that endure.</p>
  <p>Understand what type of objects you're pointing to. Knowing this [one thing](http://blog.codinghorror.com/curlys-law-do-one-thing/) will save you hours of debugging in the long haul. </p>
  <p>On that note, use the right methods or iterators for the task at hand. Choosing your tools before you start building helps your work flow tremendously. This is just as important for method construction as it is for db modelling. </p>
